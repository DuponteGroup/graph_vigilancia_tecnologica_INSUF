AB  - OBJECTIVES: Data on angiotensin receptor-neprilysin inhibitor (ARNI) 
      sacubitril-valsartan (SV) in patients undergoing maintenance dialysis is scarce. 
      Our study aimed to investigate the effect of SV on patients undergoing dialysis. 
      METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the data of end-stage kidney disease (ESRD) 
      patients undergoing either peritoneal dialysis (PD) or hemodialysis (HD) in our 
      center. A total of 51 patients receiving SV treatment were enrolled in the SV 
      group. Another 51 age and sex-matched patients on dialysis without SV treatment 
      were selected as the control group. All the patients were regularly followed up 
      in the dialysis clinic. Their clinical, biochemical, and echocardiographic 
      parameters were all recorded at baseline and during follow-up. The effect and 
      safety of SV were further analyzed. RESULTS: A total of 102 ESRD patients on 
      dialysis (51 patients in the SV group and 51 patients in the control group) were 
      finally enrolled. The median follow-up time was 349 days (interquartile range 
      [IQR]: 217-535 days). The level of B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) (median [IQR] 
      before and after SV treatment: 596.35 pg/ml [190.6-1714.85] vs. 188.7 pg/ml 
      [83.34-600.35], p < 0.001) or N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide 
      (NT-proBNP) (median [IQR]: 6316.00 pg/ml [4552.00-28598.00] vs. 5074.00 pg/ml 
      [2229.00-9851.00], p = 0.022) were significantly decreased after treatment with 
      SV. The variant rate of left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) was 
      significantly higher in the SV group compared to the control group, especially in 
      the PD subgroup. No significant difference was found in other echocardiographic 
      parameters between SV and control group. Subgroup analysis of the PD group showed 
      an increase in daily PD ultrafiltration (median [IQR]: 400 ml/d [200-500] vs. 
      500 ml/d [200-850], p = 0.114) after SV treatment. Variant rate of overhydration 
      (OH) measured by the body composition monitor (BCM) of the SV group were 
      significantly different from the control group (median [IQR]: -13.13% 
      [-42.85%-27.84%] vs. 0% [-17.95%-53.85%], p = 0.049). The rate of hyperkalemia 
      was slightly higher but without significant difference before and after the 
      introduction of SV (19.6% vs. 27.5%, p = 0.350). No event of hypotension and 
      angioedema were observed. CONCLUSIONS: SV might have a cardio-protective role in 
      ESRD patients undergoing dialysis, especially in PD patients. Serum potassium 
      should be monitored during the treatment.

TI  - Pharmacogenomics of angiotensin receptor/neprilysin inhibitor and its long-term 
      side effects.
LID - 10.1111/1755-5922.12272 [doi]
AB  - The development of the promising agent sacubitril/valsartan, known as an 
      angiotensin receptor blocker-neprilysin inhibitor (ARNI), to improve heart 
      failure (HF) management, may benefit morbidity, mortality, and readmission rates 
      in patients with HF. The PARADIGM-HF trial demonstrated that the ARNI can reduce 
      morbidity and mortality in patients with heart failure with reduced ejection 
      fraction (HFrEF), while ongoing PARAMOUNT and PARAGON-HF trials determined 
      whether the ARNI has morbidity and mortality benefits in patients with heart 
      failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF). However, the risk of long-term 
      side effects of the ARNI such as cognitive dysfunction or Alzheimer's disease 
      (AD) remains unknown. In fact, neprilysin (NEP), encoded by NEP or MME gene, is a 
      principal peptidase involved in the degradation of β-amyloid (Aβ) protein. 
      Several studies have demonstrated that polymorphisms of the NEP gene may be 
      associated with AD and cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA). Pharmacogenomics, the 
      study of variability in drug response due to genetic polymorphisms, can 
      potentially explain the variability in the effect of the ARNI and their side 
      effects. Therefore, we have attempted to highlight pharmacogenomic factors and 
      potential long-term side effects of the ARNI. Physicians should carefully monitor 
      elderly patients with genetic risk factors for AD and CAA. In the future, genetic 
      testing and genomic testing for NEP polymorphisms may play an important role in 
      monitoring long-term side effects in ARNI-treated HF patients.

AB  - The SARS-CoV-2 virus is spreading around the world, and its clinical 
      manifestation COVID-19 is challenging medical, economic, and social systems. With 
      more and more scientific and social media reports on the COVID-19 pandemic 
      appearing, differences in geographical presentations and clinical management 
      occur. Since ACE2 (angiotensin-converting enzyme 2) is the gatekeeper receptor 
      for the SARS-CoV-2 virus in the upper bronchial system, we here focus on the 
      central role of the renin-angiotensin aldosterone system (RAAS) in the SARS-CoV-2 
      virus infection, the role of pharmacological RAAS inhibitors, and specific 
      genetic aspects, i.e., single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) for the clinical 
      outcome of COVID-19. We aimed to bring together clinical, epidemiological, 
      molecular, and pathophysiological and pharmacological data/observations on 
      cardiovascular aspects in the actual SARS-CoV-2 virus pandemic. In detail, we 
      will report controversies about the Yin-Yan between ACE2 and ACE1 and potential 
      implications for the treatment of hypertension, coronary artery disease, and 
      heart failure. Here, we summarize the encouraging and dynamic global effort of 
      multiple biomedical disciplines resulted in astonishing fight against COVID-19 
      targeting the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, yet the race for ACE just 
      begun.

AB  - The renin-angiotensin system (RAS) is one of important systems among homeostatic 
      mechanisms that control the function of cardiovascular, renal and adrenal 
      systems. As RAS has a very complex nature, it has been also found as related to 
      the control of cell migration and apoptosis. Angiotensin-converting enzyme 
      inhibitors (ACEI) are drugs most commonly used in the modulation of RAS activity. 
      ACEI have been extensively described as effective in the treatment of 
      hypertension among adults, but also as drugs delaying progression in diabetic 
      nephropathy and reducing mortality in left ventricular dysfunction and congestive 
      heart failure. What is less obvious, ACEI are also widely used in pediatric 
      nephrology and cardiology. Moreover, there are more and more reports showing 
      evidence that ACEI can be beneficial in the treatment of many other diseases and 
      the pleiotropic activity of ACEI is mainly based on their antioxidant properties. 
      In this paper we focus on the less obvious possibilities of the clinical use of 
      ACEI in neurological or oncological patients, discuss the role of ACE gene 
      polymorphism and show the perspectives of potentially new applications of ACEI in 
      contemporary pharmacotherapy.

TI  - Genetic Variants Associated with Adverse Events after Angiotensin-Converting 
      Enzyme Inhibitor Use: Replication after GWAS-Based Discovery.
PG  - 342-348
LID - 10.3349/ymj.2022.63.4.342 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) are medications 
      generally prescribed for patients with high cardiovascular risk; however, they 
      are suboptimally used due to frequent adverse events (AEs). The present study 
      aimed to identify and replicate the genetic variants associated with ACEI-related 
      AEs in the Korean population. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A two-stage approach 
      employing genome-wide association study (GWAS)-based discovery and replication 
      through target sequencing was used. In total, 1300 individuals received ACEIs 
      from 2001 to 2007; among these, 228 were selected for GWAS. An additional 336 
      patients were selected for replication after screening 1186 subjects treated from 
      2008 to 2018. Candidate genes for target sequencing were selected based on the 
      present GWAS, previous GWASs, and data from the PharmGKB database. Furthermore, 
      association analyses were performed between no AE and AE or cough groups after 
      target sequencing. RESULTS: Five genes, namely CRIM1, NELL1, CACNA1D, VOPP1, and 
      MYBPC1, were identified near variants associated with ACEI-related AEs. During 
      target sequencing of 34 candidate genes, six single-nucleotide polymorphisms 
      (SNPs; rs5224, rs8176786, rs10766756, rs561868018, rs4974539, and rs10946364) 
      were replicated for association with all ACEI-related AEs. Four of these SNPs and 
      rs147912715 exhibited associations with ACEI-related cough, whereas four SNPs 
      (rs5224, rs81767786, rs10766756, and rs4974539 near BDKRB2, NELL1, NELL1 intron, 
      and CPN2, respectively) were significantly associated with both categories of 
      AEs. CONCLUSION: Several variants, including novel and known variants, were 
      successfully replicated and found to have associations with ACEI-related AEs. 
      These results provide rare and clinically relevant information for safer use of 
      ACEIs.

TI  - Effect of 24-hour blood pressure and heart rate on the prognosis of patients with 
      reduced and midrange LVEF.

AB  - Aim    Optimal combination therapy for chronic heart failure (CHF) currently 
      implies the mandatory use of at least four classes of drugs: 
      renin-angiotensin-aldosterone (RAAS) system inhibitors or angiotensin receptor 
      blocker neprilysin inhibitors (ARNI); beta-adrenoblockers (BAB); 
      mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists; and sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 
      inhibitors. Furthermore, many of these drugs are able to decrease blood pressure 
      even to hypotension and alleviate tachycardia. This study focused on the 
      relationship of 24-h blood pressure (BP) and heart rate (HR) with the prognosis 
      for CHF patients with sinus rhythm and left ventricular ejection fraction (LV EF) 
      &lt;50 % as well as on suggesting possible variants of safe therapy for CHF 
      depending on the combination of studied factors.Material and methods    Effects 
      of clinical data, echocardiographic parameters, 24-h BP, and heart rhythm (data 
      from 24-h BP and ECG monitors) on the prognosis of 155 patients with clinically 
      pronounced CHF, LV EF &lt;50 %, and sinus rhythm who were followed up for 5 years 
      after discharge from the hospital.Results    The one-factor analysis showed that 
      the prognosis of CHF patients was statistically significantly influenced by the 
      more severe functional class (FC) III CHF compared to FC II, reduced LV EF 
      (&lt;35 %), a lower 24-h systolic BP (SBP) (&lt;103 mm Hg), the absence of 
      hypotensive episodes in daytime, a low variability of nighttime BP (&lt;7.5 mm 
      Hg), a higher 24-h HR (&gt;71 bpm vs. &lt;60 bpm), the absence of therapy with 
      RAAS inhibitors + BAB, and a lower body weight index. The multi-factor analysis 
      showed that more severe CHF FC, lower LV EF, and the absence of RAAS inhibitors + 
      BAB therapy retained the influence on the prognosis. After eliminating the 
      influencing factor of drug therapy, also a low SBP variability significantly 
      influenced the prognosis. An additional analysis determined the following four 
      groups of CHF patients with reduced heart systolic function according to mean 
      24-h HR and SBP: the largest group (38.1 % of all patients) with controlled HR 
      (≤69 bpm), preserved SBP (&gt;103 mm Hg), and the lowest death rate of 15.3 %; 
      the group with increased HR (&gt;69 bpm) but preserved SBP (30.3 % of all 
      patients) where the death rate was 44.7 %, which was significantly higher than in 
      the first group; the group with normal HR (≤69 bpm) but reduced SBP (≤103 mm Hg) 
      (16.1 % of patients) where the death rate was 40 %, which was comparable with the 
      second group and significantly worse than in the first group; and the group with 
      both increased HR (&gt;69 bpm) and reduced SBP (≤103 mm Hg) (15.5 % of patients), 
      which resulted in the maximal risk of death (70.8 % of patients with CHF and LV 
      EF &lt;50 %), which was significantly higher than in the three other 
      groups.Conclusion    Low SBP (including 24-h SBP with reduced variability in day- 
      and nighttime) in combination with high HR (including by data of Holter 
      monitoring), low LV EF, more severe clinical course of CHF, and the absence of an 
      adequate treatment with neurohormonal modulators (RAAS inhibitors and BAB) 
      significantly increased the risk of death. Isolating four types of FC II-III CHF 
      with sinus rhythm and EF &lt;50% based on the combination of HR and BP identifies 
      patients with an unfavorable prognosis, which will help developing differentiated 
      therapeutic approaches taking into account clinical features.

TI  - Genome-wide association study of angioedema induced by angiotensin-converting 
      enzyme inhibitor and angiotensin receptor blocker treatment.
PG  - 770-783
LID - 10.1038/s41397-020-0165-2 [doi]
AB  - Angioedema in the mouth or upper airways is a feared adverse reaction to 
      angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEi) and angiotensin receptor blocker 
      (ARB) treatment, which is used for hypertension, heart failure and diabetes 
      complications. This candidate gene and genome-wide association study aimed to 
      identify genetic variants predisposing to angioedema induced by these drugs. The 
      discovery cohort consisted of 173 cases and 4890 controls recruited in Sweden. In 
      the candidate gene analysis, ETV6, BDKRB2, MME, and PRKCQ were nominally 
      associated with angioedema (p < 0.05), but did not pass Bonferroni correction for 
      multiple testing (p < 2.89 × 10(-5)). In the genome-wide analysis, intronic 
      variants in the calcium-activated potassium channel subunit alpha-1 (KCNMA1) gene 
      on chromosome 10 were significantly associated with angioedema (p < 5 × 10(-8)). 
      Whilst the top KCNMA1 hit was not significant in the replication cohort (413 
      cases and 599 ACEi-exposed controls from the US and Northern Europe), a 
      meta-analysis of the replication and discovery cohorts (in total 586 cases and 
      1944 ACEi-exposed controls) revealed that each variant allele increased the odds 
      of experiencing angioedema 1.62 times (95% confidence interval 1.05-2.50, 
      p = 0.030). Associated KCNMA1 variants are not known to be functional, but are in 
      linkage disequilibrium with variants in transcription factor binding sites active 
      in relevant tissues. In summary, our data suggest that common variation in KCNMA1 
      is associated with risk of angioedema induced by ACEi or ARB treatment. Future 
      whole exome or genome sequencing studies will show whether rare variants in 
      KCNMA1 or other genes contribute to the risk of ACEi- and ARB-induced angioedema.

TI  - Pharmacogenetic Risk Stratification in Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme 
      Inhibitor-Treated Patients with Congestive Heart Failure: A Retrospective Cohort 
      Study.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Evidence for pharmacogenetic risk stratification of 
      angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) treatment is limited. Therefore, 
      in a cohort of ACEI-treated patients with congestive heart failure (CHF), we 
      investigated the predictive value of two pharmacogenetic scores that previously 
      were found to predict ACEI efficacy in patients with ischemic heart disease and 
      hypertension, respectively. Score A combined single nucleotide polymorphisms 
      (SNPs) of the angiotensin II receptor type 1 gene (rs275651 and rs5182) and the 
      bradykinin receptor B1 gene (rs12050217). Score B combined SNPs of the 
      angiotensin-converting enzyme gene (rs4343) and ABO blood group genes (rs495828 
      and rs8176746). METHODS: Danish patients with CHF enrolled in the previously 
      reported Echocardiography and Heart Outcome Study were included. Subjects were 
      genotyped and categorized according to pharmacogenetic scores A and B of ≤1, 2 
      and ≥3 each, and followed for up to 10 years. Difference in cumulative incidences 
      of cardiovascular death and all-cause death were assessed by the cumulative 
      incidence estimator. Survival was modeled by Cox proportional hazard analyses. 
      RESULTS: We included 667 patients, of whom 80% were treated with ACEIs. 
      Differences in cumulative incidences of cardiovascular death (P = 0.346 and P = 
      0.486) and all-cause death (P = 0.515 and P = 0.486) were not significant for 
      score A and B, respectively. There was no difference in risk of cardiovascular 
      death or all-cause death between subjects with score A ≤1 vs. 2 (HR 1.03 [95% CI 
      0.79-1.34] and HR 1.11 [95% CI 0.88-1.42]), score A ≤1 vs. ≥3 (HR 0.80 [95% CI 
      0.59-1.08] and HR 0.91 [95% CI 0.70-1.20]), score B ≤1 vs. 2 (HR 1.02 [95% CI 
      0.78-1.32] and HR 0.98 [95% CI 0.77-1.24]), and score B ≤1 vs. ≥3 (HR 1.03 [95% 
      CI 0.75-1.41] and HR 1.05 [95% CI 0.79-1.40]), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: We 
      found no association between either of the analyzed pharmacogenetic scores and 
      fatal outcomes in ACEI-treated patients with CHF.
