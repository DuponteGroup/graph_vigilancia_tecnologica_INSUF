Our study aimed to investigate the effect of SV on patients undergoing dialysis. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the data of end-stage kidney disease (ESRD) patients undergoing either peritoneal dialysis (PD) or hemodialysis (HD) in our center. A total of 51 patients receiving SV treatment were enrolled in the SV group. Another 51 age and sex-matched patients on dialysis without SV treatment were selected as the control group. All the patients were regularly followed up in the dialysis clinic. Their clinical, biochemical, and echocardiographic parameters were all recorded at baseline and during follow-up. The effect and safety of SV were further analyzed. RESULTS: A total of 102 ESRD patients on dialysis (51 patients in the SV group and 51 patients in the control group) were finally enrolled. The median follow-up time was 349 days (interquartile range [IQR]: 217-535 days). The level of B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) (median [IQR] before and after SV treatment: 596.35 pg/ml [190.6-1714.85] vs. 188.7 pg/ml [83.34-600.35], p < 0.001) or N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) (median [IQR]: 6316.00 pg/ml [4552.00-28598.00] vs. 5074.00 pg/ml [2229.00-9851.00], p = 0.022) were significantly decreased after treatment with SV. The variant rate of left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) was significantly higher in the SV group compared to the control group, especially in the PD subgroup. No significant difference was found in other echocardiographic parameters between SV and control group. Subgroup analysis of the PD group showed an increase in daily PD ultrafiltration (median [IQR]: 400 ml/d [200-500] vs. 500 ml/d [200-850], p = 0.114) after SV treatment. Variant rate of overhydration (OH) measured by the body composition monitor (BCM) of the SV group were significantly different from the control group (median [IQR]: -13.13% [-42.85%-27.84%] vs. 0% [-17.95%-53.85%], p = 0.049). The rate of hyperkalemia was slightly higher but without significant difference before and after the introduction of SV (19.6% vs. 27.5%, p = 0.350). No event of hypotension and angioedema were observed. CONCLUSIONS: SV might have a cardio-protective role in ESRD patients undergoing dialysis, especially in PD patients. Serum potassium should be monitored during the treatment.","Sacubitril-valsartan, angiotensin receptor-neprilysin inhibitor, dialysis, end-stage renal disease","Department of Nephrology, Peking University International Hospital, Beijing, PR.

The PARADIGM-HF trial demonstrated that the ARNI can reduce morbidity and mortality in patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF), while ongoing PARAMOUNT and PARAGON-HF trials determined whether the ARNI has morbidity and mortality benefits in patients with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF). However, the risk of long-term side effects of the ARNI such as cognitive dysfunction or Alzheimer's disease (AD) remains unknown. In fact, neprilysin (NEP), encoded by NEP or MME gene, is a principal peptidase involved in the degradation of β-amyloid (Aβ) protein. Several studies have demonstrated that polymorphisms of the NEP gene may be associated with AD and cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA). Pharmacogenomics, the study of variability in drug response due to genetic polymorphisms, can potentially explain the variability in the effect of the ARNI and their side effects. Therefore, we have attempted to highlight pharmacogenomic factors and potential long-term side effects of the ARNI. Physicians should carefully monitor elderly patients with genetic risk factors for AD and CAA. In the future, genetic testing and genomic testing for NEP polymorphisms may play an important role in monitoring long-term side effects in ARNI-treated HF patients.","Alzheimer's disease, Angiotensin receptor-neprilysin inhibitor, Heart failure, Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction, Heart failure with reduced ejection fraction, Omapatrilat","Department of Internal Medicine, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, USA.; Department of Cardiovascular Medicine, Heart and Vascular Institute, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH, USA.; Department of Cardiovascular Medicine, Heart and Vascular Institute, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH, USA."

As RAS has a very complex nature, it has been also found as related to the control of cell migration and apoptosis. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) are drugs most commonly used in the modulation of RAS activity. ACEI have been extensively described as effective in the treatment of hypertension among adults, but also as drugs delaying progression in diabetic nephropathy and reducing mortality in left ventricular dysfunction and congestive heart failure. What is less obvious, ACEI are also widely used in pediatric nephrology and cardiology. Moreover, there are more and more reports showing evidence that ACEI can be beneficial in the treatment of many other diseases and the pleiotropic activity of ACEI is mainly based on their antioxidant properties. In this paper we focus on the less obvious possibilities of the clinical use of ACEI in neurological or oncological patients, discuss the role of ACE gene polymorphism and show the perspectives of potentially new applications of ACEI in contemporary pharmacotherapy.","Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, Pleiotropic activity, RAS","Chair and Department of Pharmaceutical Chemistry, Poznan University of Medical Sciences, ul.

The present study aimed to identify and replicate the genetic variants associated with ACEI-related AEs in the Korean population. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A two-stage approach employing genome-wide association study (GWAS)-based discovery and replication through target sequencing was used. In total, 1300 individuals received ACEIs from 2001 to 2007; among these, 228 were selected for GWAS. An additional 336 patients were selected for replication after screening 1186 subjects treated from 2008 to 2018. Candidate genes for target sequencing were selected based on the present GWAS, previous GWASs, and data from the PharmGKB database. Furthermore, association analyses were performed between no AE and AE or cough groups after target sequencing. RESULTS: Five genes, namely CRIM1, NELL1, CACNA1D, VOPP1, and MYBPC1, were identified near variants associated with ACEI-related AEs. During target sequencing of 34 candidate genes, six single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs; rs5224, rs8176786, rs10766756, rs561868018, rs4974539, and rs10946364) were replicated for association with all ACEI-related AEs. Four of these SNPs and rs147912715 exhibited associations with ACEI-related cough, whereas four SNPs (rs5224, rs81767786, rs10766756, and rs4974539 near BDKRB2, NELL1, NELL1 intron, and CPN2, respectively) were significantly associated with both categories of AEs. CONCLUSION: Several variants, including novel and known variants, were successfully replicated and found to have associations with ACEI-related AEs. These results provide rare and clinically relevant information for safer use of ACEIs.","Pharmacogenomics, antihypertensive agents, drug therapy, heart failure, safety","Division of Cardiology, Department of Internal Medicine, Severance Hospital, Yonsei University College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea.; Kyung Hee University College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea.; Department of Life and Nanopharmaceutical Sciences, Graduate School, Kyung Hee University, Seoul, Korea.; Department of Biostatistics and Computing, Graduate School, Yonsei University, Seoul, Korea.; Department of Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics, Kyung Hee University College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea.; Department of Biomedical Science and Technology, Kyung Hee University, Seoul, Korea. hyunihyuni@khu.ac.kr.; Division of Cardiology, Department of Internal Medicine, Severance Hospital, Yonsei University College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea. shl1106@yuhs.ac."

Furthermore, many of these drugs are able to decrease blood pressure even to hypotension and alleviate tachycardia. This study focused on the relationship of 24-h blood pressure (BP) and heart rate (HR) with the prognosis for CHF patients with sinus rhythm and left ventricular ejection fraction (LV EF) &lt;50 % as well as on suggesting possible variants of safe therapy for CHF depending on the combination of studied factors.Material and methods    Effects of clinical data, echocardiographic parameters, 24-h BP, and heart rhythm (data from 24-h BP and ECG monitors) on the prognosis of 155 patients with clinically pronounced CHF, LV EF &lt;50 %, and sinus rhythm who were followed up for 5 years after discharge from the hospital.Results    The one-factor analysis showed that the prognosis of CHF patients was statistically significantly influenced by the more severe functional class (FC) III CHF compared to FC II, reduced LV EF (&lt;35 %), a lower 24-h systolic BP (SBP) (&lt;103 mm Hg), the absence of hypotensive episodes in daytime, a low variability of nighttime BP (&lt;7.5 mm Hg), a higher 24-h HR (&gt;71 bpm vs. &lt;60 bpm), the absence of therapy with RAAS inhibitors + BAB, and a lower body weight index. The multi-factor analysis showed that more severe CHF FC, lower LV EF, and the absence of RAAS inhibitors + BAB therapy retained the influence on the prognosis. After eliminating the influencing factor of drug therapy, also a low SBP variability significantly influenced the prognosis. An additional analysis determined the following four groups of CHF patients with reduced heart systolic function according to mean 24-h HR and SBP: the largest group (38.1 % of all patients) with controlled HR (≤69 bpm), preserved SBP (&gt;103 mm Hg), and the lowest death rate of 15.3 %; the group with increased HR (&gt;69 bpm) but preserved SBP (30.3 % of all patients) where the death rate was 44.7 %, which was significantly higher than in the first group; the group with normal HR (≤69 bpm) but reduced SBP (≤103 mm Hg) (16.1 % of patients) where the death rate was 40 %, which was comparable with the second group and significantly worse than in the first group; and the group with both increased HR (&gt;69 bpm) and reduced SBP (≤103 mm Hg) (15.5 % of patients), which resulted in the maximal risk of death (70.8 % of patients with CHF and LV EF &lt;50 %), which was significantly higher than in the three other groups.Conclusion    Low SBP (including 24-h SBP with reduced variability in day- and nighttime) in combination with high HR (including by data of Holter monitoring), low LV EF, more severe clinical course of CHF, and the absence of an adequate treatment with neurohormonal modulators (RAAS inhibitors and BAB) significantly increased the risk of death.

This candidate gene and genome-wide association study aimed to identify genetic variants predisposing to angioedema induced by these drugs. The discovery cohort consisted of 173 cases and 4890 controls recruited in Sweden. In the candidate gene analysis, ETV6, BDKRB2, MME, and PRKCQ were nominally associated with angioedema (p < 0.05), but did not pass Bonferroni correction for multiple testing (p < 2.89 × 10(-5)). In the genome-wide analysis, intronic variants in the calcium-activated potassium channel subunit alpha-1 (KCNMA1) gene on chromosome 10 were significantly associated with angioedema (p < 5 × 10(-8)). Whilst the top KCNMA1 hit was not significant in the replication cohort (413 cases and 599 ACEi-exposed controls from the US and Northern Europe), a meta-analysis of the replication and discovery cohorts (in total 586 cases and 1944 ACEi-exposed controls) revealed that each variant allele increased the odds of experiencing angioedema 1.62 times (95% confidence interval 1.05-2.50, p = 0.030). Associated KCNMA1 variants are not known to be functional, but are in linkage disequilibrium with variants in transcription factor binding sites active in relevant tissues. In summary, our data suggest that common variation in KCNMA1 is associated with risk of angioedema induced by ACEi or ARB treatment. Future whole exome or genome sequencing studies will show whether rare variants in KCNMA1 or other genes contribute to the risk of ACEi- and ARB-induced angioedema.",,"Department of Otorhinolaryngology, Head & Neck Surgery and Audiology, Rigshospitalet, University of Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Denmark.; OPEN Patient data Explorative Network, Odense University Hospital, Odense, Denmark.; Department of Medical Sciences, Clinical Pharmacology and Science for Life Laboratory, Uppsala University, Uppsala, Sweden.; Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Division of Pharmacoepidemiology and Clinical Pharmacology, Utrecht University, Utrecht, The Netherlands.; Department of Medical Sciences, Clinical Pharmacology and Science for Life Laboratory, Uppsala University, Uppsala, Sweden.; Uppsala Clinical Research Center, Uppsala, Sweden.; Department of Medical Sciences, Clinical Chemistry, Uppsala University, Uppsala, Sweden.; Department of Medical Sciences, Clinical Pharmacology and Science for Life Laboratory, Uppsala University, Uppsala, Sweden.; Q-Linea AB, Uppsala, Sweden.; Department of Immunology, Genetics and Pathology, Medical Genetics and Genomics and Science for Life Laboratory, Uppsala University, Uppsala, Sweden.; Division of Population Health and Genomics, University of Dundee, Ninewells Hospital and Medical school, Dundee, UK.; Division of Population Health and Genomics, University of Dundee, Ninewells Hospital and Medical school, Dundee, UK.; Department of Intensive and Perioperative Care, Skåne University Hospital, Lund, Sweden.; Department of Otorhinolaryngology, Örebro University Hospital and Örebro University, Örebro, Sweden.; Department of Ear, Nose and Throat diseases, Amsterdam University Medical Center, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.; Department of Cardiology, Division Heart and Lungs, University Medical Center Utrecht, Utrecht, The Netherlands.; Institute of Cardiovascular Science, Faculty of Population Health Sciences, University College London, London, UK.; Health Data Research UK and Institute of Health Informatics, University College London, London, UK.; Sickla Health Centre, Nacka, Sweden.; Department of Public Health and Caring Sciences, Clinical Nutrition and Metabolism, Uppsala University, Uppsala, Sweden.; Department of Medical Sciences, Clinical Pharmacology and Science for Life Laboratory, Uppsala University, Uppsala, Sweden.; Department of Medical Sciences, Molecular Medicine and Science for Life Laboratory, Uppsala University, Uppsala, Sweden.; Division of Population Health and Genomics, University of Dundee, Ninewells Hospital and Medical school, Dundee, UK.; Division of Molecular & Clinical Medicine, Ninewells Hospital and Medical School, University of Dundee, Dundee, UK.; Swedish Twin Registry, Department of Medical Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden.; Uppsala Monitoring Centre, WHO Collaborating Centre, Uppsala, Sweden.; Department of Immunology, Genetics and Pathology, Medical Genetics and Genomics and Science for Life Laboratory, Uppsala University, Uppsala, Sweden.; Department of Otorhinolaryngology, Head & Neck Surgery and Audiology, Rigshospitalet, University of Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Denmark.; Department of Dermatology and Allergy Centre, Odense University Hospital, Odense, Denmark.; Clinical Institute, University of Southern Denmark, Odense, Denmark.; Department of Molecular & Clinical Pharmacology, University of Liverpool, Liverpool, UK.; Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Division of Pharmacoepidemiology and Clinical Pharmacology, Utrecht University, Utrecht, The Netherlands.; Department of Respiratory Diseases, Amsterdam University Medical Center, University of Amsterdam, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.; Division of Population Health and Genomics, University of Dundee, Ninewells Hospital and Medical school, Dundee, UK.; Department of Medical Sciences, Clinical Pharmacology and Science for Life Laboratory, Uppsala University, Uppsala, Sweden. mia.wadelius@medsci.uu.se."

Therefore, in a cohort of ACEI-treated patients with congestive heart failure (CHF), we investigated the predictive value of two pharmacogenetic scores that previously were found to predict ACEI efficacy in patients with ischemic heart disease and hypertension, respectively. Score A combined single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of the angiotensin II receptor type 1 gene (rs275651 and rs5182) and the bradykinin receptor B1 gene (rs12050217). Score B combined SNPs of the angiotensin-converting enzyme gene (rs4343) and ABO blood group genes (rs495828 and rs8176746). METHODS: Danish patients with CHF enrolled in the previously reported Echocardiography and Heart Outcome Study were included. Subjects were genotyped and categorized according to pharmacogenetic scores A and B of ≤1, 2 and ≥3 each, and followed for up to 10 years. Difference in cumulative incidences of cardiovascular death and all-cause death were assessed by the cumulative incidence estimator. Survival was modeled by Cox proportional hazard analyses. RESULTS: We included 667 patients, of whom 80% were treated with ACEIs. Differences in cumulative incidences of cardiovascular death (P = 0.346 and P = 0.486) and all-cause death (P = 0.515 and P = 0.486) were not significant for score A and B, respectively. There was no difference in risk of cardiovascular death or all-cause death between subjects with score A ≤1 vs. 2 (HR 1.03 [95% CI 0.79-1.34] and HR 1.11 [95% CI 0.88-1.42]), score A ≤1 vs. ≥3 (HR 0.80 [95% CI 0.59-1.08] and HR 0.91 [95% CI 0.70-1.20]), score B ≤1 vs. 2 (HR 1.02 [95% CI 0.78-1.32] and HR 0.98 [95% CI 0.77-1.24]), and score B ≤1 vs. ≥3 (HR 1.03 [95% CI 0.75-1.41] and HR 1.05 [95% CI 0.79-1.40]), respectively.
